        This is an original game I created recently that is loosely based on my experiences with e-commerce sites.  
        Ultimately it is a bit of a silly game, but I enjoyed making it and I hope you enjoy it too. 
        It is currently in its second stage of development where I am working to enhance the site by adding new 
        features and improving the quality of the user experience (the UI is fairly basic right now).  
        This is all outlined in the app&apos;s &quot;about&quot; section.

        More will be added here soon, I am in the middle of a move across the country and will be updating this page as I get settled in.
