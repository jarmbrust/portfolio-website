      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Who Am I?</h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">I am a software engineer, writer, gamer (table-top and online), animal-lover, and life-long learner.
        I originally started programming long ago on the ancient computer my family could afford back when I was 12. 
        Later however, I took a bit of a break from programming when I went to college to study history. While I loved history 
        (and still do!) I decided to return to software creation as I enjoyed the logic, creativity, and problem solving that came with it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        So, a few years after graduating with my history degree, I quit my job at the local library and went back to school.
        It was a huge challenge, as again I did this with no money and little support.  I lived in a tiny room in a rundown
        boarding house where I taught myself the basics of calculus in order to succeed in my math classes while working for
        the university as many hours as I could manage. After about three years of hard work, I graduated with a BS in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Since that time, I have worked as a software engineer for a number of companies, including everything from start-ups to
        somewhat large corporations.  There I have utilized a wide range of technologies, including SQL (SQL Server and PostgreSQL mostly),
        C#, Java, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  More recently (just over the last five years) I have focused my efforts in Vue.js,
        React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, amongst others as a frontend developer.  While I am primarily focused on the frontend,
        I am currently refreshing my SQL skills and digging a little more into Node.js for possible fullstack opportunities as well.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        In my personal life, I live with my awesome wife and our two dogs and three cats.  As of this writing (August 2025), 
        we are in the process of moving from Colorado to North Carolina to be closer to family.  
        I am currently looking for new opportunities in the area (or remotely) for this new chapter of our lives.
