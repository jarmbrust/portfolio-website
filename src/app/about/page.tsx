      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">I am a software engineer, writer, gamer (table-top and online), animal-lover, and life-long learner.
        I originally started programming long ago with BASIC on the ancient computer my family could afford back when I was 12 years old. 
        However, I then took a break from programming when I went to college to study history. While I loved history (and still do!) I
        decided to return to programming as I desired more of the logic, creativity, and problem solving that came with it.
        Really, it was a more complex choice than that, but I will save those details for another time.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        So, a few years after graduating with my history degree, I quit my job at the local library and went back to school.
        It was a huge challenge, as again I did this with no money and little support.  I lived in a tiny room in a rundown
        boarding house where I taught myself the basics of calculus in order to succeed in my math classes while working for
        the university as many hours as I could manage. After almost three years of hard work, I graduated with a BS in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Since that time, I have been working as a software engineer for a number of companies, including everything from start-ups to
        larger corporations while utilizing a wide range of technologies, including SQL (SQL Server and PostgreSQL mostly), C#, Java,
        jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more recently Vue.js, React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript amongst others. At this point
        in my career, I am mostly focused on front-end development, but I still enjoy working with back-end technologies as well.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I live with my wife and our two dogs and three cats.  As of this writing, we are in the process of moving from Colorado 
        to North Carolina to be closer to family.  I am currently looking for new opportunities in the area (or remotely) for this
        new chapter of our lives.
